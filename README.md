  - The application uses features and APIs available in Java 8, including Swing and AWT libraries for the graphical user interface. It is compatible with Java 8 and newer versions.
  - Ensure that Java is installed on your system. You can check your Java version by running `java -version` in your command line or terminal.
  - If you do not have Java installed, or if your version is older than Java 8, you can download the latest version of Java from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use an open-source alternative like [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

### Running the Application

1. Download the application's project directory.
2. Compile the project using a Java compiler.
3. Execute main method from the "BombsNChicksMain.java"-file.
